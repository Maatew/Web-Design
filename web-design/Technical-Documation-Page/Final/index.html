            <p>Why this programming language?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>IDE</li>
                <p>WebStorm is one of the latest IDEs for JavaScript. It is lightweight and has a JS code editor and debugger. You can also integrate Firebug for debugging with Firefox. It also has good support for writing HTML5 and like Aptana Studio it can connect to an FTP server to sync scripts.</p>
                <li>Software</li>
                <p>JavaScript is a robust programming language that can be applied to an HTML document and used to create dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>

                <li>Web Design</li>
                <p>JavaScript es un lenguaje de programación que los desarrolladores utilizan para hacer páginas web interactivas. Desde actualizar las fuentes de redes sociales a mostrar animaciones y mapas interactivos, las funciones de JavaScript pueden mejorar la experiencia del usuario de un sitio web.</p>

                <li>IDE</li>
                <p>PyCharm is one of the most complete and popular Python IDEs you can find, perfect for all levels of experience. It includes smart features that help you be more productive, like a code editor with context-aware suggestions as you type. It also has smart search features, is customizable, and has close to a thousand plugins to enhance it.</p>
                <li>Software</li>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        print('Hello World')

                <li>Machine Learning</li>
                <p>Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.</p>
                <p>Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
                <p>Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome. </p>
                <li>Data Scince</li>
                <p>Python is a programming language widely used by Data Scientists. Python has in-built mathematical libraries and functions, making it easier to calculate mathematical problems and to perform data analysis.</p>

                <li>IDE</li>
                <p>Released in 2001, IntelliJ IDEA is another one of the big three Java IDEs. It is available in 2 different editions, an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and a proprietary commercial edition. IntelliJ IDEA boasts cross-language refactoring and data flow analysis features.</p>
                <li>Software</li>
                <p>While some coding languages are complex and challenging to learn, Java is not. Developers say the language is easy to pick up. Its syntax is straightforward, making it easy to understand, write, and maintain. With Java, developers can write once and run anywhere (WORA).</p>

                <li>IDE</li>
                <p>Read and write code effectively with an editor that deeply understands C and C++. Have completion results filtered by type in Smart Completion. Use Breadcrumbs to track your location inside the hierarchy of scopes. Gain insight into function calls thanks to parameter name hints. Find the context usages of a symbol or simply jump to it by typing its name. CLion will even make sure your code conforms to coding guidelines, including formatting, naming, and more.</p>
                <li>Software</li>
                <p>We inferred that C is used in all spheres of hardware and software development, making it useful for upcoming software developers and software professionals, of course, who have great command over C to design complex interfaces.</p>

                <li>What is C and why it is used?</li>
                <p>C is a general-purpose computer programming language for system administration, network programming, and embedded software. It has several features that make it desirable for these applications: C program syntax is easy to learn and read; this makes debugging code more accessible and faster.</p>

                <p>GoLand makes it easy to read, write, and modify Go code. On-the-fly bug detection and suggestions for solutions, fast and safe refactorings with one-step undo, smart code completion, dead code detection, and documentation tips help all Go developers, from novices to experienced professionals, to create code quickly, efficiently and reliably.</p>
                <li>Software</li>
                <p>What is the Go program? The Go Language, just like C and C++, is a compiled and concurrent language, or in other words: it supports communication channels based on the CSP language. However, concurrency in Go is different than lock-based scheduling criteria like pthreads.</p>
